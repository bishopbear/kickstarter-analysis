# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
A client who is establishing their second Theater project has requested our team to better understand how to have a successful fundraising campaign.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to identify impacts on project success regarding the client’s initial funding goal and when the project will be launched.

## Analysis and Challenges
Looking in depth at both funding goals and launch date does give us insight into what makes a project successful. We believe that our findings within the launch date data offer an insight that cannot be ignored. The May project launch date has had by far the most success. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For a Theater project there is a correlation between funding success and launch date. May, June and July have the most successful campaigns with May having twice as much success as the lowest six months. This could be due to several factors. 

This visual includes all available theater project data. Whether the funding goal is high or low we can clearly see that if one pursuing funding via kickstarter for a theater project, the optimal time of year to launch the campaign in May, June or July.



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
After reviewing the data the goal amount is not as important of a factor as the launch date. I would want to ask Louise more questions. It depends on what scale her project is. The data regarding the goal amount does not show that the actual goal amount makes any difference between the amounts of $5,000 and $25,000. 

If Louise’s next project goal falls in this range, then she needs to focus on other aspects of the project for her to realize success. Below $5,000 does seem to correlate with a higher amount of success as well as between approx. $37,500 and $42,500.00. However, there is a drastic drop off in success once a project asks for $45,000.00
or higher. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A challenge I ran into was using COUNTIFS function. I had not used this before and was having trouble understanding the instructions – was I supposed to filter the data table then use countifs? Or leave the data unfiltered and use countifs to go through it. I did the latter. I also had trouble with the color formatting on excel. It was not straightforward and hard to understand which accent went with what color.



## Results

       - What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
* Regardless of funding goal, late spring and early summer correlate with the highest amount of project success.
* While there are markedly more successful campaigns launched in late spring and early summer there is consistently about the same number of failures. Without doing more research this would lead me to believe that timing of the launch is only part of the equation. 


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The lower the goal the higher rate of success. There also seems to be a pocket of successful projects in the higher 30k to low 40k range. It seems that projects asking for more than $45,000.00 are doomed to fail.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data does not offer any information regarding who the backers are, how the project is marketed, or any more information about what the project actually is.  This data set only provides enough information to show correlation. We would need more data to provide answers as to causation.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Are there any consistencies within the successful projects and the failures. Could we get any information regarding who is creating the projects. On average, how long does it take a successful campaign to reach their goal? This time frame would allow us to know during the campaign if we are on track or not.
